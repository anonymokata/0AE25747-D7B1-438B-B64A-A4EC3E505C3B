initial configure and make the project
$ ./autogen.sh                      this will call required automake, autconf 

to make project project after
NOTE: you may encounter 
$ ./mymake.sh

(NOTE: mymake calls in order
1) make                     to build romancalc library file and program
2) cd tests							
3) make check_romancalc     build the check_romancalc program
4) cd ..
5) make check               run the check program

'----------------------- end of my docs --------
from money example
This is the "money example" from the Check tutorial.

You need the following programs installed on your system:
-- Autoconf 2.59
-- Automake 1.9.6
-- Libtool 1.5.22
-- Check 0.9.9

Somewhat earlier versions of these programs might work.

Then, do as follows:

$ autoreconf --install
#####$ ./configure
$ ./configure CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
$ make
$ make check

Don't do "make install" unless you want to install the money example.

money.c and money.h are built as a library.  src/main.c:main() is a
client of libmoney.la, just as tests/check_money.c:main() is a client
of libmoney.la

Please send bug reports to check-devel AT lists.sourceforge.net.
